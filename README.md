# OceanKita Station Analysis

This repository contains data analysis and visualization of oceanographic station data for OceanKita. The purpose of this analysis is to explore environmental variables such as temperature, salinity, and other sensor readings across various monitoring stations.

## Overview

The analysis focuses on:
1. Cleaning and preprocessing of raw station data.
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover spatial and temporal patterns.
3. Visualization of variables across stations and time.
4. Statistical summaries and insights for further interpretation.

All analysis is conducted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook (`OceanKita_Station_Analysis.ipynb`).
